[Code52.i18n]

--Getting Started--

We don't want to overwrite your default layout - in fact, it requires us to jump through some hoops and we're afraid we might annoy you. 

If you could kindly change your Views/_Layout.cshtml file to look like this:

@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.Code52.cshtml";
}

that'd be awesome.

--Customizing--

If you want to update your master page (say if you've got some sweet markup), you'll need to have a look at the Views/Home/Index.cshtml and see 
which has a section like this:

@section featured {
	<!-- bitching markup here -->
}

Because of that, we've got our own _Layout.Code52.cshtml file. Feel free to modify that to suit.

--Cleanup--

Lastly, to switch it back to how you had it, just change your Views/_Layout.cshtml file back to:

@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}
